# RucoyFarmer
This is a color based bot written in Java for the game "Rucoy Online"
You assign creatures by color, and the bot will kill them until stopped.
It will use health potions when you are low, and mana potions as well.

It has a built in Login client that was written for my server, however the server is not included.
